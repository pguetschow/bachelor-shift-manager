# Enhanced Benchmark KPIs Documentation

## Overview
The benchmark command has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive analysis of scheduling algorithms across different company sizes and contract types.

## New Graph Types Generated

### 1. Average Working Hours per Month by Contract Type
- **File**: `monthly_hours_by_contract.png`
- **Description**: Shows monthly trends for 32h and 40h contracts separately
- **Insights**: 
  - Seasonal patterns in workload distribution
  - Contract type efficiency comparison
  - Algorithm performance across different contract types

### 2. Enhanced Fairness Analysis
- **File**: `fairness_comparison.png`
- **Metrics**:
  - **Gini Coefficient**: Measures inequality (0 = perfect equality, 1 = maximum inequality)
  - **Standard Deviation**: Spread of working hours across employees
  - **Coefficient of Variation**: Relative variability (CV = std_dev/mean)
- **Insights**: Comprehensive fairness assessment across multiple dimensions

### 3. Coverage Analysis
- **File**: `coverage_analysis.png`
- **Metrics**:
  - Coverage percentage per shift type
  - Comparison against minimum and maximum staffing requirements
  - Visual indication of understaffed/overstaffed shifts
- **Insights**: Shift-specific performance and staffing efficiency

### 4. Constraint Violations
- **File**: `constraint_violations.png`
- **Categories**:
  - **Weekly Hours Violations**: Exceeding max_hours_per_week
  - **Rest Period Violations**: Insufficient rest between shifts (< 11 hours)
- **Insights**: Algorithm compliance with labor regulations

### 5. Additional Interesting Metrics
- **File**: `additional_metrics.png`
- **Metrics**:
  - Runtime performance comparison
  - Total hours worked (efficiency measure)
  - Min/Max hours spread (workload distribution)
  - Total constraint violations (compliance score)

## Additional Interesting Metrics to Consider

### 1. Employee Utilization Metrics
- **Overtime/Undertime Analysis**: Track excessive overtime and underutilization
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of available capacity used
- **Absence Impact**: How absences affect overall scheduling efficiency

### 2. Shift-Specific Performance
- **Shift Preference Satisfaction**: How well algorithms respect employee shift preferences
- **Shift Rotation Patterns**: Distribution of different shift types per employee
- **Night Shift Distribution**: Fairness in night shift assignments

### 3. Temporal Analysis
- **Weekend Work Distribution**: Fairness of weekend assignments
- **Holiday Coverage**: Performance during holiday periods
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Algorithm performance across different seasons

### 4. Cost and Efficiency Metrics
- **Labor Cost Optimization**: Minimizing overtime costs
- **Staffing Efficiency**: Optimal use of available staff
- **Coverage Gaps**: Days/shifts with insufficient coverage

### 5. Employee Satisfaction Indicators
- **Work-Life Balance Metrics**: Consecutive work days, rest periods
- **Predictability**: Consistency in schedule patterns
- **Flexibility**: Ability to accommodate individual preferences

### 6. Operational Metrics
- **Schedule Stability**: How much schedules change between runs
- **Algorithm Convergence**: Time to reach optimal solution
- **Scalability Performance**: How performance degrades with problem size

### 7. Quality Metrics
- **Solution Completeness**: Percentage of required shifts filled
- **Constraint Satisfaction Rate**: Percentage of constraints satisfied
- **Solution Diversity**: Variety of different valid solutions found

### 8. Business Impact Metrics
- **Customer Service Level**: Impact on service quality
- **Operational Continuity**: Risk of service disruption
- **Compliance Score**: Adherence to labor laws and company policies
