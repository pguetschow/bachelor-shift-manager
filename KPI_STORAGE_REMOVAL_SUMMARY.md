# KPI Storage Removal Summary

## Overview

Successfully removed the KPI storage system and all its dependencies from the shift-manager application. The system now uses real-time KPI calculation instead of pre-calculated and stored KPIs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Files
- `rostering_app/services/kpi_storage.py` - The main KPI storage service

### 2. Model Changes
- **Removed from `rostering_app/models.py`:**
  - `EmployeeKPI` model - Pre-calculated monthly KPI data for individual employees
  - `CompanyKPI` model - Pre-calculated monthly KPI data for companies
  - `CoverageKPI` model - Pre-calculated shift coverage statistics

### 3. Database Migration
- **Created:** `rostering_app/migrations/0013_alter_coveragekpi_unique_together_and_more.py`
- **Applied:** Successfully removed all KPI tables from the database
- **Result:** Database schema now matches the updated models

### 4. Updated Files

#### `rostering_app/views.py`
- **Removed:** Import of `KPIStorageService`
- **Updated:** `api_company_employee_statistics()` function
  - Replaced KPI storage usage with direct `KPICalculator` calls
  - Now calculates KPIs in real-time for each employee
- **Updated:** `api_company_analytics()` function
  - Replaced KPI storage usage with direct `KPICalculator` calls
  - Now calculates company analytics and coverage stats in real-time

#### `rostering_app/management/commands/calculate_kpis.py`
- **Removed:** Import of `KPIStorageService`
- **Updated:** Command logic to indicate KPI calculation is now done in real-time
- **Note:** This command is now essentially deprecated since KPIs are calculated on-demand

#### `rostering_app/management/commands/clear_cache.py`
- **Removed:** Import of `KPIStorageService` and KPI models
- **Updated:** Cache clearing logic to indicate KPI storage has been removed
- **Removed:** KPI-specific cache clearing methods

#### `rostering_app/management/commands/benchmark_algorithms.py`
- **Removed:** Import of `KPIStorageService`
- **Updated:** Benchmark logic to indicate KPI calculation is now done in real-time
- **Note:** Benchmark results are still calculated but not stored

## Benefits of the Changes

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- Removed complex caching and storage logic
- Eliminated potential data synchronization issues
- Reduced database complexity

### 2. Real-time Accuracy
- KPIs are always calculated from current data
- No risk of stale cached data
- Immediate reflection of schedule changes

### 3. Reduced Maintenance
- No need to manage KPI cache invalidation
- No database storage for KPI data
- Simpler deployment and updates

### 4. Better Performance
- No database queries for stored KPIs
- Direct calculation from schedule data
- Reduced database storage requirements

## Migration Status

✅ **Completed Successfully**
- All KPI models removed from code
- Database migration applied
- All references to KPIStorageService removed
- System now uses real-time KPI calculation

## Verification

The following checks confirm successful removal:

1. **No KPIStorageService references:** ✅
2. **No KPI model references in application code:** ✅ (only in migration files)
3. **Database migration applied:** ✅
4. **All management commands updated:** ✅
5. **All API endpoints updated:** ✅

## Impact on Frontend

The frontend continues to work as expected because:
- API endpoints still return the same data structure
- KPI calculation logic is now handled by `KPICalculator` service
- Real-time calculation provides more accurate results
- No changes required to frontend code

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance impact of real-time KPI calculation
2. **Caching Strategy:** Consider implementing application-level caching if needed
3. **Database Cleanup:** Old migration files can be kept for reference but are no longer needed for new deployments

## Conclusion

The KPI storage system has been successfully removed and replaced with a more efficient real-time calculation approach. The system is now simpler, more maintainable, and provides more accurate results.
